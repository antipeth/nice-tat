# About Me

Hey there, I'm a computer science student. I dig rock music, Linux, and all things intriguing.

# My Philosophy

Go with the flow and do what I love. Typically, I'm into efficient stuff; they keep everything running smoothly. However, sometimes I enjoy things that don't appear efficient at all. It's a whole different vibe, my quirky way of life.

# Foundations

`Arch Linux` is my go-to system on my personal computer, and I absolutely love it. It performs like a champ. Just a heads up, I roll with `EndeavourOS` for more convenient NVIDIA GPU support.

`Hyprland` is my window manager. I used `KDE` before, also a top-notch desktop environment with loads of ecosystem support, but I prefer `Hyprland` for its simplicity and customization.

`Waybar` sits atop my screen, keeping me informed.

`Zsh` is my shell, paired with plugins for an enhanced experience.

`Kitty` is my terminal. Chose it for better image support. Also, I might throw Alacritty on my machine too.

`Paru` is my AUR helper, written in Rust, and it rocks.

# My Apps

`Yazi` is my terminal file manager, crafted in Rust.

`Rofi` is my app launcher.

`Brave` is my browser, while Firefox is my backup browser.

`Neovim` is my text editor. Learning it and trying to make it my go-to for everything.

`Code-OSS` assists me with larger projects. Opted for it over VSCodium for no reason other than I just prefer it.

BetterBird is my email client, an enhanced version of Thunderbird.

Anytype is my note-taking and planning software. It uses blockchain technology for surprisingly fast sync speeds and is feature-packed. Anytype for everything.

Bitwarden keeps my passwords safe.

Btrfs-assistant for easier snapshot management.
